# homebrew-harrysthings

This is my personal tap, that I use to distribute my stuff on Homebrew.

## My formulas

- [hello-homebrew](https://github.com/Essay97/hello-homebrew): my first package distributed on Homebrew! It just says hello to Homebrew, but I learnt a lot from it
- [adventure-engine](https://github.com/Essay97/tadvkt): a CLI tool to create and play your own text adventures
